    <h1>Calisthenics - Another way to train your body</h1>

                <h2>A little intro</h2>
                <p> Calisthenics is a type of exercise based on the use of body weight to
                    develop strength, flexibility, endurance and balance, without the need
                    for extra equipment, with the aim of toning your body with technique.
                    Among the most common exercises are push-ups, pull-ups, squats,
                    dips and stretches that can be done anywhere, making it a very accessible option for everyone.
                    Calisthenics is ideal for both beginners and advanced athletes, since the difficulty of the movements 
                    can be adapted to each person's abilities.

            <section>
                
                <p>In addition to building strength, calisthenics exercises improve
                    flexibility, mobility and core stability, contributing to better joint health
                    and body posture. The benefits are not limited to the physical: the
                    workout also benefits mental health, reducing stress and improving
                    mood. This means that anyone, regardless of experience, can progress at their own pace.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As an additional note, never do the same workout every day because the body needs to rest the muscles and it is also possible that you get muscle fatigue, 
                    which is when you overload yourself with too many exercises and the body cannot resist. <mark>Water is essential</mark> at the end of each series, and as a tip it is 
                    good to buy a jar of protein (creatine) for better results.

                <h2>As my experience...</h2>
                <p> 
                    It takes time to shape your body, so when I started it was very difficult to adapt to a routine, after the first three days I 
                    wanted to give up because you feel how you are working certain muscles that you didn't know you were working. Now with two and 
                    a half years of experience I have been perfecting my technique in each exercise until today.Here are some recommendations that helped me:                    
                    You should always start with a light warm-up to avoid injuries, such as jumping rope until tired or jogging, and you
                    alternate the series of exercises every day from 10 to 15 repetitions. At home I used simple objects such as chairs, broomsticks, 
                    weighted backpacks with books, bottles of sand and a mat.

                </p>
           
        
                <p>
                    Now, before starting a routine, you must first know your body type. For example: 
                    if you exercise and gain muscle, you are a mesomorph, or if you have a hard time gaining weight and muscle, 
                    you are an ectomorph (like me). I also know a series of simple stretches to gain flexibility and balance. 
                    On the other hand, when doing a push-up, you need to be in an inclined position, with your hands clinging to the ground, 
                    opening them slightly, your head facing the ground without tensing your neck (neutral), bringing your elbows inwards.
                </p>
            
                                             
                <p>
                    The physical changes are not immediate. After training for a month, you will notice a small change in your level of strength and grip. 
                    From two to four months you will begin to notice a physical change, whether your arms and legs are a little wider. 
                    After six months your body will become a machine, you will notice more strength and endurance. In addition to this, 
                    you should take into account a good diet depending, for example: if you want to gain muscle you start with a volume routine, where you should consume products with a high protein content such as eggs, 
                    meat, rice, grains; if you want to define your body, you should start with a definition routine where you lower the level of food to start 
                    losing fat and gain muscle naturally.

            <h2>Anecdote</h2>
            <p>
                I remember I was trying out a slightly more demanding routine, I wanted to try doing a different type of push-up, pike push-ups and arches, 
                I started trying out the variations and in the distance I heard a buzzing sound, I thought it was my ears and I didn't pay attention to it, while 
                I was doing it the buzzing sound was so loud that I got up and immediately grabbed a broomstick to scare away the swarm of bees behind me, as I was just warmed up 
                I jumped from the terrace to the second floor of the yard and ran out of there.
